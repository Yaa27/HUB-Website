            Our team launched the first project called “HUB Workshops” which was firstly held on 02/06/2024. The workshop was led by invited participant Mr. Fadoul Mazzawi who has vast experience in the business world being the founder and chairman of Mazzawi Group and Mazzawi Advertising, board director and member of several organizations as the Israel-American Chamber of Commerce and much more. Overall the first workshop attracted more than 80 students and they learnt about how Mr. Mazzawi started his business and the mindset of his younger self gave the audience more motivation and inspiration to start on their own, aligning with our core value of giving students more than theoretical knowledge in class.
